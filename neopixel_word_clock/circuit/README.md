Circuit schematic and PCB are designed with CadSoft EAGLE 7

The part-list and component-placement-files are written to be directly uploaded to JLCPCB for full assembly service. The gerber files are provided and can be used with JLCPCB or any other PCB fabricator.

Some parts are missing and will have to be purchased separately from Digi-Key. Especially the 8x8 RGBW NeoPixel matrix board from Adafruit.
