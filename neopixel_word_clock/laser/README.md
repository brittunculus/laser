Laser cutting SVG files provided. Optimized for the FLUX Beamo but works on all laser cutters. Pay attention to the layer order. The engraving needs to be heavy enough to cut into the acrylic pretty deep.

You will need a few pieces of opaque black 3mm thick acrylic, and a single piece of 3mm thick LED-transparent black acrylic.

The 3D model is also provided, it's a SolidWorks 2008 file.
