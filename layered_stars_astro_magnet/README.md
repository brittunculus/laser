This is a small display for my astrophotographs. The photograph is printed on a sticker that's stuck to a black acrylic sheet at the back. Layers of clear acrylic sheets is stacked in front of the sticker, each layer has stars laser-etched on. This achieves a floating stars effect, inspired by snow-globes.

The SVG files used to laser-cut and laser-etch the acrylic sheets can be downloaded from this GitHub repo. The files are layered and optimized for making 6 pieces at a time on A4 sized acrylic sheets. The stars are randomly arranged, and two versions of arrangments are provided (12 different randomizations total).

The holes on the "back" piece requires a M3 threading tap, so no nuts are required. The holes on the "stars" sheet are sized to be through-holes. The screws are 10mm long M3 threaded screws.

Sticky magnets are used on the back to turn these into fridge magnets. Place two magnets on each, make sure one magnet is at the bottom, which helps it stand up when placed on a desk.
